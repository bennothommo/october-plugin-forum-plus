# Forum Plus plugin

Drop-in enhancement for the RainLab Forum plugin. The plugin provides extended functionality to supercharge your Forum
on your October CMS website:

- **Questions and Answers:** Allow community members to post questions in specially defined forum channels, and allow others to post answers to their questions. In Q&A topics, the original question author or a moderator will be able to accept an answer, promoting it as the answer that solved their question.
- **Voting:** Allow forum users to vote up (or optionally, down) topics in your forum, or even individual posts. This is useful for topics that are used for judging the popular opinion of certain topics or posts.

The plugin has been designed in such a way so that a developer can use this alongside the Forum plugin with ease.
