# Forum Plus plugin

Drop-in enhancement for the [Forum plugin by RainLab](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-forum). The plugin provides extended functionality to supercharge your Forum on your October CMS website:

- **Questions and Answers:** Allow community members to post questions in specially defined forum channels, and allow others to post answers to their questions. In Q&A topics, the original question author or a moderator will be able to accept an answer, promoting it as the answer that solved their question.
- **Voting:** Allow forum users to vote up (or optionally, down) topics in your forum, or even individual posts. This is useful for topics that are used for judging the popular opinion of certain topics or posts. Applicable uses

The plugin has been designed in such a way so that an October CMS installation using the Forum plugin can have this plugin added, with very minimal manual intervention required - just change a couple of components and you are good to go! It's even easy to remove - just uninstall the plugin, switch the components back to the components provided by the Forum plugin, and all your topics and posts will still be available.

For more complex installations, such as sites that are using custom templates for the forum, please feel free to read through the **Upgrade Guide** to find instructions on upgrading to Forum Plus.

## Example Use Cases

- **Support Forums:** Allow users to post requests for support for your product or service, and accept the answer that resolves their request for future users to refer to.
- **Competitions:** Allow users to vote for certain posts to determine who has the best post or topic in a competition.
- **Feature Requests:** Allow users to vote for specific topics that are requesting new features for your product or service, giving you a keen insight into what your community wants.

## What is this repository for?

This repository serves as a place to review most of the source code contained in the plugin, and to allow people to post issues and pull requests, or provide translations, for the plugin if they wish.

Note that this repository is missing the **Plugin.php** file that defines the plugin, as the bulk of the plugin's functionality resides in this file. You will need to purchase the plugin on the [October CMS marketplace](https://octobercms.com/plugin/bennothommo-forumplus) in order to gain access to this file.
